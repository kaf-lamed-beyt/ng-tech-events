# Contributing

First off I have to thank you for wanting to contributing to this project. You rock ðŸ¤˜! Please read the process below.

We recently moved to using tables to represent the data here. This [Pull Request](https://github.com/kaf-lamed-beyt/ng-tech-events/pull/35) by [Samuel Peters](https://github.com/Petsamuel) helped us accomplish that.

So the experience of contributing to this repository isn't completely arduous for you, downloading this Vscode extension &mdash; [Markdown table prettifier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=darkriszty.markdown-table-prettify) &mdash; can help reduce the friction of working with tables in markdwon.

Feel free to suggest other extensions that you think may be better than the aforementioned one to.
